# openssl-ml-dsa
A project implementing ML-DSA signature operations using OpenSSL for post-quantum cryptography. The project provides unified functionality for generating key pairs, signing messages with context support, and verifying signatures through a single comprehensive script that consolidates all test vector data into a unified JSON structure.
